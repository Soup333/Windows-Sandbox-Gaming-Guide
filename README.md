# Windows-Sandbox-Gaming-Guide
This is a guide to making a persistent Windows Sandbox and also using it for gaming

Keep in mind that this still uses RDP which is outputting at around 30 fps. Though it seems running games at higher frame rates make it smoother and displays with BFI (Black Frame Insertion) improves the experience.
